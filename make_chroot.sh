# This script creates a basic chroot environment for each users websites.
# It is designed to work with the directory structure in the tutorial.
# You can call this script directly but it is designed to be called
# from the usersite.sh script when setting up a new user account.
#
# The actual application and library copy process is managed by the
# update_chroot.sh script which this script calls after setting up the
# static environment.
#
# This is based off the work by Wolfgang Fuschlberger
#   http://www.fuschlberger.net/programs/ssh-scp-sftp-chroot-jail/
#
# Features in this version:
#  - Ubuntu specific 
#  - Moved to bash for better shell coding
#  - Added php,curl,unzip,tar,false to the list of applications
#  - Builds mini_sendmail automatically for mail support
#  - Includes ImageMagick if required for a particular user
#  - Include timezone and zoneinfo in chroot
#  - Creates skeleton /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf
#  - Create new users and build chroot for them
#  - Use the chroot root directory as $HOME
#	i.e. separate chroot jail for each user
#  - Use /etc/sudoers.d/ scripts for each user
#  - Does not greate a group for the user
#  - Enable SCP and SFTP in the chroot jail
# 
# This version does NOT support moving existing users into a chroot.
#
# USAGE:
#  make_chroot.sh username group chroot
#   username - the user name to create (must NOT exist)
#   group	 - the users primary group (must already exist)
#   chroot   - where to create the users chroot directory
#              the username will be appended automatically
#

# First lets make sure parameters are correct and define some globals
USERNAME="$1"
PRI_GROUP="$2"
CHROOT_DIR="$3/$USERNAME"
MYPWD=$(echo $PWD)

# User must NOT exist
if [[ "$(id -un $USERNAME 2> /dev/null)" == "$USERNAME" ]]; then
	echo "ERROR: User '$USERNAME' already exists"
	exit 1
fi

# Group MUST exist
if ( ! groups $PRI_GROUP &> /dev/null ); then
	echo "ERROR: Group '$PRI_GROUP' does not exist"
	exit 1
fi

# The chroot user directory must not exist
if [[ -e "$CHROOT_DIR" ]];  then
	echo "ERROR: The chroot '$CHROOT_DIR' already exist"
	exit 1
fi


# Path to SSHD config so we can find sftp-server
SSHD_CONFIG="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"


# This script MUST run as root because of file permissions
if [[ "$(whoami 2> /dev/null)" != "root" ]] && [[ "$(id -un 2> /dev/null)" != "root" ]]; then
	echo "ERROR: $0 must be run as root!"
	exit 1
fi

if [[ ! -e /etc/debian_version ]]; then
	echo "ERROR: $0 only supports Ubuntu (and probably other Debian derived distributions)"
	exit 1
fi


# The chroot does not include ImageMagick by default
cat << EOF

QUESTION: The chroot does NOT include ImageMagick by default,
however if you want the script can copy in the ImageMagick
commands and libraries. This will provide support for:
  JPEG, PNG, TIFF
And the ImageMagick commands:
  /usr/bin/identify
  /usr/bin/composite
  /usr/bin/convert
  /usr/bin/montage
  /usr/bin/mogrify

Do you want ImageMagick setup in this userâ€™s chroot?
