# Apache 2.4 Varnished CHROOTED PHP-FPM WordPress Virtual Host

Andrew Bevitt <me@andrewbevitt.com>

Read the [tutorial](http://andrewbevitt.com/tutorials/apache-varnish-chrooted-php-fpm-wordpress-virtual-host/) to learn how this all fits together.

NOTE: This is no longer maintained! Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) has Apache 2.4.7 built-in.

The tutorial outlines how I configured an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server to run:

* Apache 2.4 with the Event MPM
* Virtual hosts separated by users
* Each user having a chrooted home
* PHP 5.4 with FPM and APC
* WordPress
* Varnish
* MOD_WSGI

I spent about a week making sure this process is repeatable but of course I can't predict every scenario and configuration so please get in touch if you have some suggested improvements.
